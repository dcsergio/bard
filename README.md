## A simple bash script to make my console busy
For work, I needed to connect to a bastion host via PuTTY to reach a VM.
After a while, the connection went down, due to inactivity of console.
So, I wrote this simple script, that keeps the console busy, 
showing on the screen some text, taken from files in the "poems" folder.

It is very simple to use:
- copy into your favourite folder
- launch it :-)

All contributions and improvements are welcome.
