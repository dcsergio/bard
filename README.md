## A simple bash script to make my console busy
For work, I needed to connect to a bastion host via PuTTY to reach a VM.
After a while, the connection went down, due to inactivity of console.
So, I wrote this simple script, that keeps the console busy, 
showing on the screen some text, taken from files in the "poems" folder.

Is is very simple, all contributions and improvements are welcome.
